	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		Well, you can't deny that one reason is money. If a programmer got paid the same as someone working at Starbucks, then I doubt many people would bother.
		Anothr reason it's popular is there's starting to be a lot more resources to learn programming. It's a different kind of learning than in most traditional CS degree from a university. These days, many would-be programmers only think of programming as web development, and they only think front-end and back-end and "apps".
		Before the web came around, most programmers that were learning never thought in terms of apps, that is a working product of some sort. Most CS courses were trying to teach concepts. The thought of building a full app was too time consuming, so you had smaller projects that weren't apps.
